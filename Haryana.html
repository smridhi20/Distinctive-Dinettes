        <h3>Cyber Hub Social</h3>
        <p>Social has become a brand name now and Cyber Hub Social lives up to all the hype. The drinks and food are served in innovative style and everything on the menu is worth ordering (literally!). It is built around an old chawl theme and is all things pretty. As you enter, you will feel it resembles a small middle-class home from the 1990s with a strong feeling of togetherness. Old fashioned tube lights, a big center table and chair woven in plastic threads all takes us back to our childhood days. There are different seating areas inspired by different chawl settings. Carrom boards are used as table-tops and the train compartments stood out the most. The whole ambiance is chaotic, yet exciting and full of buzz which makes it a top one in the list of best theme restaurants in Gurgaon. </p>
