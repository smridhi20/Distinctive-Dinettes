        <h3>Cafe Shillong Heritage</h3>
        <p> Caf√© Shillong Heritage offers open air seating and you can have your meals under the clear blue sky in the day and a star covered night sky in the evening. Choose from a massive menu of excellent Pan-Asian, Mediterranean, Continental and North-Eastern specialties. Wine connoisseurs can also spend some time tasting from its limited but exotic wine menu. The non vegetarian menu is a cut above the vegetarian menu although if you happen to go for the latter, you are not likely to be disappointed.  </p>
