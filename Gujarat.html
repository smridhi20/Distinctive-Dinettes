        <h3>seva Cafe</h3>
        <p> Driven by volunteers and operated by modest staff, our meals are cooked and served with love, and offered to the guest as a genuine gift.Imagine a restaurant where there are no prices on the menu and where the check reads Rs.0 with only this footnote: "Your meal was a gift from someone who came before you. To keep the chain of gifts alive, we invite you to pay it forward for those dine after you."
            That's Seva Cafe, a experiment in 'peer to peer' generosity. </p>
